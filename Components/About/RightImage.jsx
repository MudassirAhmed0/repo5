            The company has expanded into global shipping and logistics, growing from simple express delivery between two locations in KSA to a global e-commerce logistics solution provider. This stable, yet rapid expansion has been— and continues to be— fueled in large part by the entrepreneurship of its founders and the diligence of its people.  </p>

        Founded in 1990 with just two locations as the first private delivery service in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA), Zajil Express now operates in more than 100 offices with more than 1,000 employees in 4 continents working hard to deliver more than 20,000 packages every day.
